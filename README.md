# hello-world
My first github repository!
Hi everyone, Thanks for taking the time to read a bit about myself.  In case you were wondering, I'm considered a giant since I live in a world where the average human is 2.2 ft tall.  Where I come from, I'm the average height of females at 5'4".  It's all good though.  I can finally see the stage at shows, reach the highest cabinet and essentially step over anyone walking slowly in front of me.  Life is good. Minus hitting my head on things. Peace.
